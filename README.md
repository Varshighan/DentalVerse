# 🦷 AR/VR Dental Training Simulator

> Immersive learning through technology — a next-gen solution for dental education using Unity, Blender, and Meta Quest.

---

## 📖 Overview

This project develops an **Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Virtual Reality (VR)** simulation platform to transform traditional dental education. By leveraging immersive technologies, students and professionals can interact with detailed **3D dental anatomy**, tools, and procedures in a virtual space — enhancing practical learning without physical constraints.

Developed with **Unity**, **Blender**, and deployed on **Meta Quest**, the application introduces hand-tracking and gesture-based interaction for an intuitive, hardware-light learning experience.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Model realistic **3D dental anatomy** and tools.
- Create **interactive simulations** for training and diagnosis.
- Use **hand-tracking and gesture recognition** via Meta Quest.
- Deploy as an **immersive, scalable educational solution**.
- Focus on **cost-effective**, reusable training environments.
